# Suicide Ideation Detection in Tweets

This project is a Streamlit web application that classifies tweets based on their content into three categories:
- **Suicidal**: Tweets that indicate clear suicidal intent.
- **Potential Suicide Post**: Tweets that show signs of potential suicide ideation.
- **Not Suicidal Post**: Tweets that are not related to suicide ideation.

The project also includes a feature to generate word clouds for the input tweets or text files to visualize common words associated with the tweet content.

## Features
- **Tweet Classification**: Classify tweets into three categories: Suicidal, Potential Suicide Post, or Not Suicidal Post.
- **Text or File Input**: Users can either type a tweet or upload a text file for classification.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: A word cloud visualizes the most frequent words in the input text to help identify common patterns.

## Here is a list of dependencies you need to install:

- streamlit: For building the web application.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning and text processing.
- wordcloud: For generating word clouds.
- matplotlib: For visualizing the word cloud.
- pickle: For loading pre-trained models and transformers.
